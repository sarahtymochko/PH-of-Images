### Code

The following examples (some of which are used in the paper) are:
1. Concentric Rings - `Rings.ipynb`
2. Disk with Spots - `Disk_With_ManySpots-Simple.ipynb` (just compute bottleneck distances), `Disk_With_ManySpots-wBounds.ipynb` (compute bottleneck distances and theoretical bounds for comparison)

The majority of the code is contained in the two .py files:
- generate_examples.py contains code to generate many example images 
    - `create_circles_image`: 2 dimensional disk (of any resolution)
    - `make_checkerboard`: Chessboard (of any resolution with any number of squares) 
    - `make_rings_example`: three concentric rings example from the paper (of any resolution)
    - `create_diskwithspot`: A disk with one spot in the middle (fixed resolution of 2048x2048)
    - `create_diskwithmanyspots`: A disk with many spots (fixed resolution of 2048x2048)
- utils.py contains functions related to:
    - Image processing: Compute DSEDT (discrete signed Euclidean distance transform), binarize an image based on a threshold, downsample using the averaging technique described in our paper
    - TDA: Use giotto-TDA to compute persistent homology and bottleneck distance. 
    
### Figures

The Figs folder contains figures used in the paper as well as the same plots with respect to pixel size (where the high resolution image has pixel size=1), rather than resolution.
